### Description

    This application allows a user to create and edit news articles. Users are allowed
    change the status of news articles once they have been created. Users can publish a news
    article, archive a news article and finally leave an article in its default state
    after it has been created (draft state).

    Once a news article has been created the user is free to continuously edit the article.
    Once a news article has been archived, the user is no longer able to edit it. A news
    article can also be deleted.
